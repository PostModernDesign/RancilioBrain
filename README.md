You certainly dont need to puchase these components from amazon, you can find them on ebay or banggood or aliexpress as well. It's usually worth it to get a few of the same because it's easy to ruin them during prototyping.

Besides the enclosure assembly, you will need suitable wire, various [spade connectors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078PMWNJC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and 2 quality [40A Relays](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E1LC1VK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I've used 200ÂºC Temp resistant silicone wire for all lengths runnning inside the machine, [18AWG](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0746HMTPP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the relays and [22AWG](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M0O1NXM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the 5V signal wires.

You will also need to reroute the ground to the 3 way valve so that solenoid if you plan to have solenoid control independent of pump control like I do. Otherwise just piggyback the poles of the brew switch.
